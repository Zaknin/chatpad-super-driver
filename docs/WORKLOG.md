## 2026-06-29T11:25Z — Protocol integration verification (session 3)

- **Objective:** Verify applied script changes and run full builds (parser + protocol + driver)
- **Starting branch and commit:** `test/protocol-fixtures` / `664aa66bfb5bfca8c8319…`
- **Investigation:** Confirmed all changes applied to working tree (ChatpadWin11.sln, Directory.Build.props, Build-Driver.ps1, ChatpadFilter.vcxproj). Driver builds ChatpadProtocol as dependency, then builds ChatpadFilter separately with its own IntDir/OutDir.
- **Files modified:** 7 files modified, 3 files untracked (ChatpadProtocol.vcxproj, ChatpadProtocolTests.vcxproj, Test-ChatpadProtocol.ps1)
- **Commands and tests run:**
  - `pwsh -File tools/Test-ChatpadProtocolParser.ps1` — 85/85 passed
  - `pwsh -File tools/Test-ChatpadProtocol.ps1 -Configuration Debug` — 85/85 passed
  - `pwsh -File tools/Test-ChatpadProtocol.ps1 -Configuration Release` — 85/85 passed
  - `pwsh -File tools/Build-Driver.ps1 -Configuration Debug -Platform x64` — PASS, 0 warnings, 0 errors
  - `pwsh -File tools/Build-Driver.ps1 -Configuration Release -Platform x64` — PASS, 0 warnings, 0 errors
  - Confirmed ChatpadFilter linker dependencies: ntoskrnl, hal, wmilib, WdfLdr, WdfDriverEntry, BufferOverflowFastFailK (no ChatpadProtocol.lib linked)
  - Confirmed SpectreMitigation=Spectre inherited from Directory.Build.props
- **Generated artifacts:** All under `artifacts/` (ignored by Git)
- **Results:** All 4 build/test configurations pass. Parser 85/85 assertions in all configurations. Driver builds cleanly with Spectre mitigation. No SignTool execution. Repository safety passes.

## 2026-06-29T14:30Z — Continuity repair: close protocol integration checkpoint

- **Objective:** Repair stale continuity documents, restore removed durable decisions, correct project dependency representation, validate, commit, and push.
- **Starting branch and commit:** `test/protocol-fixtures` / `969990ca9e532643b750a3fc1820a4c31770fd44`
- **Investigation:** HEAD was at 969990c (not 664aa66 as PROJECT-STATE.md claimed). Prohibited commit 6502452 confirmed not an ancestor of HEAD. Pre-integration DECISIONS.md recovered from parent commit 664aa66. ChatpadProtocolTests.vcxproj used hardcoded AdditionalDependencies/AdditionalLibraryDirectories with a redundant SolutionDependencies section in the sln.
- **Files modified:**
  - `docs/PROJECT-STATE.md` — updated HEAD to full commit hash, removed "no new commit" language, added dependency relationship and implementation state sections.
  - `docs/NEXT-TASK.md` — replaced stale commit instruction with next bounded task (kernel-safe shared protocol interface boundary design), updated starting commit, safety restrictions, and acceptance criteria.
  - `docs/DECISIONS.md` — restored 4 historical durable decisions from commit 664aa66, appended 4 new integration decisions (protocol build integration, SignTool detection expansion, PowerShell 5.1 compatibility, native ProjectReference).
  - `tests/protocol/ChatpadProtocolTests.vcxproj` — replaced hardcoded AdditionalDependencies/AdditionalLibraryDirectories with native ProjectReference to ChatpadProtocol.vcxproj (GUID {A1B2C3D4-E5F6-4789-ABCD-EF0123456789}).
  - `ChatpadWin11.sln` — removed redundant SolutionDependencies section (ProjectReference handles build ordering).
- **Commands and tests run:**
  - `pwsh -File tools/Test-ChatpadProtocolParser.ps1` — 85/85 passed
  - `pwsh -File tools/Test-ChatpadProtocol.ps1 -Configuration Debug -Platform x64` — MSBuild exit 0, test exit 0, 85/85
  - `pwsh -File tools/Test-ChatpadProtocol.ps1 -Configuration Release -Platform x64` — MSBuild exit 0, test exit 0, 85/85
  - `pwsh -File tools/Build-Driver.ps1 -Configuration Debug -Platform x64` — exit 0, NotSigned, no SignTool
  - `pwsh -File tools/Build-Driver.ps1 -Configuration Release -Platform x64` — exit 0, NotSigned, no SignTool
  - `pwsh -File tools/Test-RepositorySafety.ps1` — PASS
  - `git diff --check` — clean
  - `git diff HEAD -- legacy/` — no changes
  - `git merge-base --is-ancestor 6502452 HEAD` — confirmed not ancestor
- **Validation results:** All builds pass, all safety checks pass, no generated output tracked, legacy/ untouched, parser not linked into driver.
- **Commit:** `docs: close protocol integration checkpoint`
- **Push:** `origin/test/protocol-fixtures`
- **Remaining risks or limitations:** None.

## 2026-06-29T16:01+04:00 — Kernel-safe shared protocol interface and WDK compile check

- **Objective:** Create a portable shared protocol type/interface boundary,
  prove the complete five-byte parser compiles under the x64 WDK toolchain in
  Debug and Release without linking it into `ChatpadFilter`, run all parser and
  driver regressions, update continuity, commit, and push.
- **Starting branch and commit:**
  `feature/kernel-safe-protocol-interface` /
  `c18b40b2c66ec9c529567ae2df3d01e3a233b6b8`; clean and aligned with
  `origin/feature/kernel-safe-protocol-interface`.
- **Continuity discrepancy:** At start, `PROJECT-STATE.md` and `NEXT-TASK.md`
  still named the prior `test/protocol-fixtures` checkpoint. Project state also
  listed only KMDF 1.15. Live detection found installed KMDF headers/libraries
  through 1.35, while driver diagnostic linker input confirms the existing
  `ChatpadFilter` target remains KMDF 1.15. The continuity files now state both
  facts explicitly.
- **Investigation:** The existing parser exposed types and the function in one
  header and included MSVC standard integer/size headers. A first strict WDK
  compile correctly failed because MSVC user-mode `stdint.h` collided with the
  WDK kernel CRT. Protocol-owned `ChatpadUInt8` and `ChatpadSize` aliases fixed
  the boundary without WDK types or warning suppression. A second WDK compile
  exposed `NULL` as an undeclared standard-header dependency; private parser
  pointer checks now use the C null pointer constant `0`, preserving behavior.
- **Files created:**
  - `src/protocol/ChatpadProtocol/ChatpadProtocolTypes.h`
  - `tests/kernel/ChatpadProtocolKernelCompileCheck/ChatpadProtocolKernelCompileCheck.c`
  - `tests/kernel/ChatpadProtocolKernelCompileCheck/ChatpadProtocolKernelCompileCheck.vcxproj`
  - `tests/kernel/ChatpadProtocolKernelCompileCheck/README.md`
  - `tools/Test-ChatpadProtocolKernelCompatibility.ps1`
- **Files modified:** `ChatpadWin11.sln`, `docs/BUILDING.md`,
  `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/NEXT-TASK.md`, `docs/PROJECT-STATE.md`,
  `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md`, `docs/WORKLOG.md`,
  `src/protocol/ChatpadProtocol/ChatpadKeyboardParser.c`,
  `src/protocol/ChatpadProtocol/ChatpadKeyboardParser.h`,
  `src/protocol/ChatpadProtocol/ChatpadProtocol.vcxproj`, and
  `src/protocol/ChatpadProtocol/README.md`.
- **Implementation:** Shared public types require no Windows or WDK API and use
  no packing, allocation, exceptions, STL, RTTI, templates, handles, transport
  state, retained pointers, or mutable globals. The compatibility project
  compiles the full parser and a consumer as C with `/W4 /WX`, produces only a
  static `.lib` under `artifacts/`, and has no entry point. The solution adds
  only Debug/Release x64 mappings and no project dependencies.
- **Toolchain detection:** exit 0; Visual Studio 2022 17.14.35; MSVC
  14.44.35207; SDK/WDK 10.0.26100.0; latest installed KMDF 1.35; x64 Spectre
  libraries 14.44.35207.
- **Commands and verified results:**
  - `tools/Get-DriverBuildEnvironment.ps1` — exit 0.
  - `tools/Test-RepositorySafety.ps1` — PASS before implementation and during
    every build/test wrapper.
  - `git diff --exit-code HEAD -- legacy/` — exit 0.
  - `git merge-base --is-ancestor 6502452 HEAD` — exit 1, confirmed not ancestor.
  - `tools/Test-ChatpadProtocolParser.ps1` — exit 0, 85/85.
  - `tools/Test-ChatpadProtocol.ps1 -Configuration Debug -Platform x64` —
    MSBuild exit 0, test exit 0, 85/85.
  - `tools/Test-ChatpadProtocol.ps1 -Configuration Release -Platform x64` —
    MSBuild exit 0, test exit 0, 85/85.
  - `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/Test-ChatpadProtocolKernelCompatibility.ps1 -Configuration Debug -Platform x64`
    — MSBuild exit 0; library
    `artifacts/bin/x64/Debug/ChatpadProtocolKernelCompileCheck/ChatpadProtocolKernelCompileCheck.lib`;
    SHA-256 `804A41BFF6CC57F980A7E35950091E0599B821C370EAB152EBA0ECE452079FA5`.
  - Same Windows PowerShell 5.1 command with `Release` — MSBuild exit 0;
    library
    `artifacts/bin/x64/Release/ChatpadProtocolKernelCompileCheck/ChatpadProtocolKernelCompileCheck.lib`;
    SHA-256 `848AE61D1B9F27F49E9F0AC51E94DF804AB0D5D059977A1DB7938AEC8B9DEE33`.
  - `tools/Build-Driver.ps1 -Configuration Debug -Platform x64` — exit 0,
    NotSigned, no SignTool; SHA-256
    `44bbeab24279397609d8f07fee63bb4ee0a71f4683c3980fb3738794c71ecdff`.

    `96848ec8d743828b79a6c20c93c3f33fe7258ee78fda071a475bfcd4fc110552`.
- **Failed checks retained honestly:** Initial WDK builds failed first on the
  `stdint.h`/kernel-CRT warning collision and then on undeclared `NULL`; both
  boundary dependencies were removed before successful reruns. The first
  Windows PowerShell 5.1 run failed because `ConvertFrom-Json` returned a
  nested installation array; the script now flattens it and both 5.1 reruns
  pass. One ad hoc summary wrapper passed named arguments positionally and
  printed a stale zero after binding errors; those results were discarded and
  both integrated commands were rerun directly with exit 0 and 85/85.
- **Driver isolation proof:** `ChatpadFilter.vcxproj` has no `ProjectReference`,
  parser source, or compatibility source. `ChatpadWin11.sln` has no
  `ProjectDependencies` section. Debug/Release diagnostic linker commands use
  `driver.obj`, `device.obj`, kernel libraries, and KMDF 1.15 libraries only;
  neither `ChatpadProtocol.lib`, the compatibility `.lib`, nor the parser
  symbol is present.
- **Safety result:** No `.sys` was created by the compatibility project; no
  signing task ran; no output escaped `artifacts/`; no INF, CAT, certificate,
  package, service, installer, or deployment file was added. No USB, HID,
  IOCTL, device, PnP, power, callback, injection, transport, or hardware code
  was introduced. Nothing was installed, signed, packaged, deployed, loaded,
  or tested against hardware. `legacy/` and external skills were not modified.
- **Generated artifacts:** All build outputs and diagnostic logs are beneath
  ignored `artifacts/` and are not committed.
- **Commit and push:** Commit exactly
  `build: add kernel-safe protocol interface check`; push only
  `origin/feature/kernel-safe-protocol-interface`.
- **Remaining risks or limitations:** Compile compatibility only. The parser is
  not connected to runtime driver code; unresolved protocol fields remain raw.

## 2026-06-29T16:14+04:00 — Offline protocol state machine

- **Objective:** Add an evidence-constrained, transport-independent protocol
  state machine using synthetic offline classifications, preserve parser
  behavior, compile through user and WDK toolchains, prove driver isolation,
  update continuity, commit, and push.
- **Starting branch and commit:**
  `feature/offline-protocol-state-machine` /
  `804393c9c9e1c0b976c0ad73f6f1fcc5c57de5c2`; clean and aligned with origin.
- **Continuity discrepancy:** The parent continuity files correctly described
  the completed kernel-interface branch rather than this newly prepared branch.
  They were updated to the live branch and current objective before handoff.
- **Investigation:** `docs/CHATPAD-PROTOCOL.md` proves the existing five-byte
  keyboard packet and only the presence of `0x90, 0x00` in an internal legacy
  structure. It does not prove a complete initialization sequence, status
  codes, readiness, retry/timeout policy, or transport behavior. Therefore the
  state machine accepts neutral caller classifications and performs no raw
  initialization/status decoding.
- **Files created:**
  - `src/protocol/ChatpadProtocol/ChatpadProtocolStateMachine.h`
  - `src/protocol/ChatpadProtocol/ChatpadProtocolStateMachine.c`
  - `tests/protocol/ChatpadProtocolStateMachineTests.h`
  - `tests/protocol/ChatpadProtocolStateMachineTests.c`
  - `tests/protocol/fixtures/ChatpadProtocolStateMachineFixtures.h`
- **Implementation:** Caller-owned state records awaiting classification,
  accepted keyboard data, unsupported input, policy-rejected input, or
  unresolved control/status. Explicit events include reset. Transition output
  records previous/current state, applied event, and whether state changed.
  Null pointers, invalid states/events, and invalid parser enum values are
  rejected safely; non-null failed outputs are cleared deterministically.
  Parser argument/length failures remain unclassified and cause no transition.
- **Build integration:** Added the state-machine source/header to
  `ChatpadProtocol.vcxproj`; added focused tests and synthetic event fixtures to
  `ChatpadProtocolTests.vcxproj`; added state-machine source/header and a compile
  consumer to the isolated kernel compatibility project; extended the direct
  compiler script to compile/link both implementation and test sources.
- **Documentation modified:** `docs/CHATPAD-PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/BUILDING.md`,
  `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/NEXT-TASK.md`, `docs/PROJECT-STATE.md`,
  `docs/WORKLOG.md`, `src/protocol/ChatpadProtocol/README.md`,
  `tests/protocol/README.md`, `tests/protocol/fixtures/README.md`, and
  `tests/kernel/ChatpadProtocolKernelCompileCheck/README.md`.
- **Test count:** 174 assertions total: original parser 85 plus state machine 89.
- **Windows PowerShell 5.1 validation:**
  - `tools/Get-DriverBuildEnvironment.ps1` — exit 0.
  - `tools/Test-RepositorySafety.ps1` — PASS.
  - `git diff --exit-code HEAD -- legacy/` — exit 0.

    `b317141364878e1c441639a56d35b97aa8fbb4f24847bd0dda0fa9e12f089f3e`.
- **Driver isolation proof:** `ChatpadFilter.vcxproj` has no project reference,
  parser/state-machine source, or protocol name. The solution has no dependency
  section. Debug/Release diagnostic linker commands contain only driver objects
  and kernel/KMDF libraries; no protocol or compatibility library is linked.
- **Safety:** Compatibility builds produced only `.lib` artifacts; no `.sys`,
  INF, CAT, certificate, package, service, installer, or deployment output.
  No hardware, USB, HID, IOCTL, callback, injection, semantic key mapping,
  installation, signing, packaging, deployment, loading, or external skill
  action occurred. `legacy/` remained unchanged.
- **Generated artifacts:** All binaries and logs remain beneath ignored
  `artifacts/` and are not committed.
- **Commit and push:** Commit exactly `feat: add offline protocol state machine`;
  push only `origin/feature/offline-protocol-state-machine`.
- **Remaining risks or limitations:** Raw initialization/status forms remain
  unresolved. The state machine is an offline classification layer only and is
  not connected to runtime driver code.

## 2026-06-29T16:36+04:00 — Chatpad initialization and status evidence audit

- **Objective:** Perform a read-only legacy-source audit of initialization,
  response, status, keepalive, timing, retry, IOCTL, and internal-state
  evidence; correct continuity; commit and push documentation only.
- **Starting branch and commit:** `analysis/init-status-evidence` /
  `55a1af2c1418a95fcda51038c1b299cb5a75b91f`; clean and aligned with
  `origin/analysis/init-status-evidence`. Prohibited commit `6502452` was not
  an ancestor.
- **Continuity discrepancy:** The inherited project-state and next-task files
  accurately described the parent state-machine checkpoint but named that
  parent branch rather than this prepared audit branch. They were updated to
  current repository truth before handoff.
- **Investigation:** Targeted searches and compact line ranges covered the sole
  `0x90` occurrence, all references to initialization structures and flags,
  user-mode request serialization, filter-side WDF control transfer creation,
  initialization triggers, completion paths, continuous reads, `f0` handling,
  and periodic requests. `CHATPAD_INIT_REQUEST` is declaration-only. The
  executable path sends payload `09 00`, not `90 00`.
- **Confirmed control path:** `main` -> `ChatpadControlMainLoop` -> one
  `InitChatpad` call -> internal Microsoft-init flag IOCTL -> three unexplained
  no-data control requests -> two-byte control-IN -> control-OUT with payload
  `09 00` -> second control-IN. The filter copies the eight setup bytes into a
  WDF setup packet and provides optional IOCTL bytes 9+ as the data stage.
- **Status and success boundary:** The filter marks Microsoft initialization
  complete on USB configuration selection. Two returned bytes are logged but
  never compared. `chatpadInitFinished` is never set true or read. Received
  `f0` packets are ignored with unknown meaning. Alternating `001f`/`001e`
  no-data requests are called keep-alives but have no response validation.
  Therefore no acknowledgement, response/status format, retry policy, or
  objective ready state is confirmed.
- **Files created:** `docs/CHATPAD-INIT-STATUS-EVIDENCE.md`.
- **Files modified:** `docs/PROJECT-STATE.md`, `docs/CHATPAD-PROTOCOL.md`,
  `docs/NEXT-TASK.md`, and append-only `docs/WORKLOG.md`.
- **Validation before editing:** `tools/Test-RepositorySafety.ps1` — PASS;
  `git diff --exit-code -- legacy` — exit 0; prohibited-ancestor check — exit
  1 as required.
- **Validation after editing:** repository safety, whitespace, legacy-diff,
  documentation-only scope, forbidden-file, staged-diff, and final-status
  checks are recorded by the final report for this task. No build was required
  or run.
- **Artifacts:** None generated.
- **Commit and push:** Commit exactly
  `docs: audit chatpad initialization status evidence`; push only
  `origin/analysis/init-status-evidence`.
- **Remaining risks or limitations:** Meanings of the mystery requests,
  control-IN responses, `f0` packets, `001f`/`001e` periodic requests, and an
  objective ready condition remain unresolved. The next safe boundary is a
  neutral offline representation and construction tests for confirmed setup
  tuples and payload only.
- **Safety:** `legacy/` remained untouched. No implementation, hardware,
  driver, build-project, external-skill, installation, signing, packaging,
  deployment, loading, capture, or runtime action occurred.
